# COVID-Graph-Plotter

Allows instant plotting of data posted by the UK Government Coronavirus Dashboard: https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/
A list of names of metrics and where in the hierarchy an area is: https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/download

## Installation

Head on over to the release page for the latest version, or download the python source code and run `main.py`

Or to use an online version (v1.2.5): https://trinket.io/python3/9694673877?outputOnly=true&runOption=run

## Usage
### Entering the areas of Interest: 
```
First Area:
Second Area:
etc
```
This software allows comparison of a maxiumum of 4 different areas currently. So enter the names of the areas which you wish to compare.

To the side of this is a drop-down list of region types. This is **only** for use for some areas which appear under multiple categories. To spot this when plotted, these regions will extend beyond others:

Examples of these regions are Manchester and Camden. To fix this a region type needs to be specified (`utla` in this case):
